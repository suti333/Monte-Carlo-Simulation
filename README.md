# Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo Simulation is a computational technique that uses random sampling to model and analyze complex systems. In finance, it's commonly employed to assess the range of possible outcomes for an investment or portfolio. By running multiple simulations with randomly generated inputs, it provides insights into the potential future performance and associated risks. Monte Carlo simulations help decision-makers make informed choices by considering a spectrum of possible scenarios rather than relying on a single deterministic forecast.

The efficient frontier comprises optimal portfolios that provide the maximum expected return for a specified level of risk or the minimum risk for a given expected return. Portfolios below the efficient frontier are suboptimal, offering insufficient return for the associated risk. Similarly, portfolios to the right of the efficient frontier are suboptimal as they entail higher risk for a given rate of return.
