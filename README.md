# Monte Carlo Simulations

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses random sampling to model and analyze complex systems. In finance, it's commonly employed to assess the range of possible outcomes for an investment or portfolio. By running multiple simulations with randomly generated inputs, it provides insights into the potential future performance and associated risks. Monte Carlo simulations help decision-makers make informed choices by considering a spectrum of possible scenarios rather than relying on a single deterministic forecast.
